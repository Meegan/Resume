	# Resume

	## Hullo! 

	My name's Matt Egan, and I'm a web developer/lead developer whose currently looking for employment. I have a wide array of skills, both when it comes to technology and people. I'm currently working a lot in the M(ongoDB) E(xpressJS) A(ngularJS) N(odeJS) stack, but have a fair amount of experience with Wordpress and traditional LAMP environments as well. I love working in teams, and am flexible in whatever position you may need me on your team.

	If you'd like to know more, check out the PDF I have in this repo (https://github.com/Meegan/Resume/blob/master/resume-matt-egan.pdf), or shoot me an email (matt.l.egan@gmail.com). I'd love to chat!

	Thank you,

	Matt
